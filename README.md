# ChessML


## Todos:
- en passe and castling logic
- turn by turn play with input
- parser to take in standard chess notation and converts to a piece and its move
- AlphaZero implementation
- experiments with transformers:
  - can we train a model to learn the rules of the game (with low illegal move rate)
  - can this same model be used to play the game at a sufficiently high ELO?
	- so , while Im sure we can have an llm which generates plausible looking games, can we augment the model with another learnable objective (ie winning game)?
	- as im writing this, it sounds loopy and nonsensical, and will probably change and refine as I get more into the nitty gritty
